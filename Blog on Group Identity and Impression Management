            <p>As of January 2021, there were 4.66 billion active internet users worldwide, which was 59.5 percent of the global population according to Statistica, a leading provider of market and consumer data. The graph blow is a display showing Statistica’s collected data on active internet users, as well as social media users, which happens to be a large portion of the overall internet users. Regularly using social media means that people can show their individuality, but they must remember they have a public identity to maintain, or they will deal with the consequences.   </p>
            <p>Whether it be a negative or positive effect, social media has an impact on people’s identities which also effects their workplace. Depending on a person’s career choice, they can get ahead of others by using social media for marketing and recruiting resources. Millions of people are using social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok to earn money to sell products or for publicity. </p>
            <p> “We construct the technology, but the technology also constructs us. We become what the technology allows us to become.” In this Ted-talk professor Schultze explains how social media can affect our sense of self-worth and personal significance. For example, if a woman has low self-worth, she might try to use social media to post pictures of herself to receive compliments and gain popularity. Depending on the audience and the content of the picture’s viewers may say she is begging for attention or looks overly sexual, and then it can negatively affect her workplace identity. How a person portrays themselves to the social media world will reveal their public identity which will affect all the in-groups they belong to such as, family, friends, and employment.</p>
            <p>Since groups and teams of have a public identity of their own to maintain, they are likely to expect the members to behave in accordance with the public image. If someone violates the group’s identity, then they may be excluded from the group. This directly relates to how social media can negatively affect one’s identity in a workplace. We will examine multiple instances in which social media negatively effects a person’s workplace identity. </p>
            <p>The first example in the top 10 Facebook posts that got people fired, is a teen who drew racist remarks on another teen who was asleep and took a picture of herself holding the marker. Although she thought she was being funny and harmless, she didn’t realize that being a cheerleader made her a public representation for the Patriots, the New England NFL team and they wouldn’t want to keep racist representation.</p>
            <p>Some of these examples in the video are of people who didn’t realize how they would affect others, and they certainly impacted more than just their own employment. In 2008, thirteen Virgin Atlantic employees created posts that criticized the company’s safety standards and insulted passengers that were on previous flights. These posts not only got the employees fired but caused a financial burden on the company by taking customers trust away. </p>
            <p>Speaking poorly of a supervisor or manager on social media is another way for someone to lose their job. One of the examples in this video a woman created a post in which she called her boss insulting names, meanwhile she forgot that she was friends with him. He saw her post, and he fired her by replying to the post that was written to insult him. Another example of posting about a superior, is what the video refers to as the “disloyal royal”. In this case not only was the employee fired for what he wrote on social media, but he was also looked down upon by his country. Cameron Kelly was a royal guard for Kate Middleton and Prince William and made a post insulting the royal couple using vulgar language. Being fired was expected, but he is lucky that he didn’t get charged with treason. </p>
            <p> When a person chooses to be employed by the educational system, they should expect to be in the public eye and watched carefully since they are developing our countries future. The 7th example in this video is a 5th grade teacher who posted on Facebook that she wanted to drown her students because they are the devil. Not only did she get fired, but many people think that she should not be allowed to work with children again. It will be difficult for her to use her degree in the future and now her entire identity has changed.  </p>
            <p>Not only can a person’s social media content get them fired from their current employment, but it can stop them from getting hired at a job they haven’t even interviewed for.  Job recruiters are using social media to filter out the negative prospects by looking at not only the type of content, but the grammar, spelling and the amount of time they are active on social media.  In the above video social media professor Janet Johnson states, “What you share becomes your brand.” She urges people to only post pictures and things that a person would be willing to share with their boss.  </p>
            <p> The examples in this blog show that social media can influence a person’s workplace identity in multiple ways and the level of impact varies according to the situation. We are all individuals who want freedom and rights, but we must remember our actions will affect the groups we belong in. Therefore, it is important to be mindful of what we post on social media.  </p>
