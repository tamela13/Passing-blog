            <p><b>Passing</b>: Throughout history, there are many examples of racial, gender, and religious forms of passing. The action of “passing” means hiding one’s identity and purposely being recognized as part of a group to gain reward or avoid conflict.  This informative blog was created to discuss the instances of passing that are current in our culture and examine the reasons people use contemporary passing. </p>
            <p>People have different experiences, backgrounds, and opportunities that mold who they are and what groups they identify with. One concern everyone has in common is that they want approval from their peers and want to be part of a group. Whether a person is black or white, Jewish, Christian or Buddhist, a Democrat or Republican, they will all crave to belong at some point throughout their life. When their need for approval outweighs their wish to be excepted for who they are, they may begin passing, which will lead them to present themselves as a part of a culture that is temporary or not legitimate (Garfinkel, 1967).</p>
            <p>A remarkable instance of passing is demonstrated in Seconde Nimenya’s TEDxTalk. Seconde is an international award-winning author and speaker who coaches people by inspiring them to discover their individuality. After her daughters helped her come to the realization that she had been passing as a Canadian, she then decided to dedicate her life to bridging the gaps between race, culture, leadership, and education. Seconde is a coach to students in high schools and universities, and she explains how youth’s biggest problem today is not academic achievement, but it is their main issue is that they fear being different because of race, gender, sexual orientation, or religion. The anxiety that this fear creates hinders their ability to fulfill their full potential.  </p>
            <p>The Uncertainty Reduction Theory (UTC) states that within groups, people are pressured to obtain and display characteristics that are associated with the roles they are assigned to in the group (Berger, 1975). When this theory was started over forty years ago, the roles people felt they needed to pass as were somewhat different, but the concept still fully applies today. From the past to present, a person’s race, gender, or religion are the main areas people feel pressured to act a certain way, which will cause people to feel the need too some form of passing to fit in. This relates to role play, which is based on having agreed-upon norms and demonstrates how we communicate and perform our identities within and outside of the group (Garfinkel, 1967). Currently, people still struggle with their race, gender, and religious identities but in this generation, people also must think about sexual orientation and political identity.  </p>
            <p>Most people want to be perceived as exceptional, and if they fit into an impressive group, then they see themselves as impressive. The pressure to fit in is one of the reasons that someone might deny their sexual orientation and try to pass as the opposite of how they feel. Although our culture has become more accepting of different sexualities, many people still feel the pressure to be the way accepted into the in-group that their peers perceive as superior or correct.</p>
            <p>In 2016, there was an uproar about gender and restroom use. People were arguing and hiring lawyers all over our country to deal with the issue of whether or not it is acceptable for the opposite sex to use a gender-specific bathroom. Some people conveyed the reason was they worried about this issue is because of safety. They are concerned a heterosexual man would be passing as a transgender person for only one day, simply to follow women or girls into a restroom. This accusation created animosity amongst transgender people because they thought their freedom was being taken from them by the government. Some felt the worries of others would cause the government to create laws that will make them pass as the opposite gender they associate with. A few states fought to make laws about gender restroom use and the fight is still going on 5 years later. In 2016, Indiana initiated a bill to pass a law that would make it a crime for a person to enter a single-sex public restroom that does not match the person’s “biological gender,” defined in terms of chromosomes and sex at birth. The punishment could be up to a year in jail and a five-thousand-dollar fine (Gersen, 2016).  While some states are fighting to make these regulations, other states are doing the opposite. As of June 2018, there was no federal anti-discrimination law that provided protections on the based on  sexual orientation or gender identity, but after the restroom controversy, many states have been working on implementing new laws.  </p>
            <p>With regards to gender-specific restrooms, the question is, in which instance is the transgender person passing? Some people think that the transgender person is trying to pass as something they are not, and others feel the transgender people are being told to pass as an identity they don’t associate with. This issue led to thousands of lawsuits and is an ongoing issue. Reasons for passing as a different identity may have changed over the 100 years, but it is still a worry for today’s society.   </p>
